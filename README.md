## Data Sources
The project includes various Formula 1 datasets covering:
- **Circuits**: Information about F1 racing circuits
- **Constructors**: Team/constructor data
- **Drivers**: Driver profiles and statistics
- **Lap Times**: Detailed lap time data split across multiple files
- **Pit Stops**: Pit stop timing and strategy data
- **Qualifying**: Qualifying session results
- **Races**: Race event information
- **Results**: Complete race results

## Files Description
- **Large datasets** are split into multiple files for better handling:
  - Lap times data is split into 5 CSV files
  - Qualifying data is split into 2 JSON files

## Project Documentation
- **CC_Final_Project plan.pdf**: Initial project planning and objectives
- **CC_INTERMEDIATE PROGRESS REPORT.pdf**: Mid-project progress report
- **Analysis on Formula1 Race.pdf**: Final analysis and findings
- **CC Final Project demo.mp4**: Video demonstration of the project
